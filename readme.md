# About
A Steam chat bot based off KraxBot 3.0, but uses a different programming language, so not really.
Why? To make it easier to run for other users and to provide a simple GUI.

# State of the Project
The application hasn't worked since July 2018, but it's not dead, yet. This project relies on the SteamKit library, which does not yet properly support the new chat until the [2.5 update](https://github.com/SteamRE/SteamKit/projects/4) releases. After that releases (or a beta version testing support for the new chat), an update will shortly follow adding support for the new chat. Please give the project a watch if you want to get notified when this update gets released! Thanks and stay tuned!

# Features
The bot has a lot of different features! Here are some of them:

* Sending messages between a Discord channel and a Steam chatroom
* Spam protection
* Link resolving for YouTube, Steam etc.
* Cleverbot (With Cleverbot.IO)
* Rules
* Keeping different settings for different chatrooms
* Runs on Windows, Linux and macOS
* And more!

# Pre-Built Executables
Check the releases page. Currently, some manual steps are required to run it on Linux and macOS. If enough people are intrested in running it on those systems, I might make special executables for them.

# Compiling yourself
Clone it and open `KraxBotOSS.sln` in your favourite IDE and hit build. Recommended is Visual Studio 2017.

# Running on Windows
Just open `KraxbotOSS.exe`. If that doesn't work, make sure you have .NET 4.7.2 installed,
If you don't, you can download it [here](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/thank-you/net472).

# Running on Linux/Mac
Check the wiki, Mac should be similar to Linux.

# Versioning
Like KraxBot, every 1.x update will bring new features and every 1.x.x update will either extend one of the current features or just be a bug fix.
